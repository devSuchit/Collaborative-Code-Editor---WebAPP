# Store organisation

## Store structure

The store stucture follows the states of each individual component.
The store will have a key for the state of each individual component.

## Reducers

A reducer each is used for the state associated with one component.

## Actions

A set action is associated with each variable of a component's state within the store, each with its own action creator.

## Selectors

A selector is associated with each variable of a component's state within the store.

Note: It is a high level selector and prop based selection must be performed within the component.
